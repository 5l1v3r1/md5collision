# md5collision

Python code to find two md5 hashes having the same few initial characters.

Can be typically used in a php code where there is a loose comparison(==) between two md5 hashes.
You can specify the few starting characters of the hash in the md5collision.py file and calculate the resultant collision hash.

Note: This program will take some time to calculate the matching hashes and won't work for for all the starting characters.
